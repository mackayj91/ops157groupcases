    <!-- SECTION 1: Supply Chain Challenge Strategist -->
    <h2>1. Challenges</h2>
    <p>GreenWear faces significant fluctuations in raw material costs due to volatile cotton prices and fluctuating freight rates from Southeast Asia. These have led to higher landed costs and unpredictable cash flow, challenging financial planning.</p>
    <p>Frequent delays at trans-shipment ports and inconsistent quality inspections at manufacturing partners create variability in lead times, impacting the ability to maintain stock availability across key markets in the USA, UK, and France.</p>
    <p>Supplier reliability issues persist due to occasional non-compliance with social and environmental standards, creating reputational risk and the need for costly third-party audits and supplier development programs.</p>
    <p>The global competitive environment pressures GreenWear to lower prices while rising costs squeeze margins, making it difficult to balance ethical commitments with financial sustainability.</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Challenge</th><th>Impact</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Raw material price volatility</td><td>Cash flow unpredictability</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Port delays</td><td>Stockouts in key markets</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Supplier non-compliance</td><td>Reputational and audit costs</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Competitive pricing pressure</td><td>Margin squeeze</td></tr>
    </table>

    <!-- SECTION 2: Supply Chain Competitive Strategist -->
    <h2>2. Competition</h2>
    <p>GreenWear operates in a highly competitive apparel market with fast-fashion giants offering lower prices and faster trend adoption. This puts pressure on GreenWear's differentiation based on ethical sourcing and quality.</p>
    <p>While GreenWear's commitment to transparency is a market strength, it currently lacks agility in product launches, missing key seasonal windows which competitors exploit with flexible supply chain structures and rapid design-to-market processes.</p>
    <p>Limited investment in digital supply chain tools places GreenWear at a disadvantage compared to competitors using advanced demand forecasting and AI-driven inventory management to reduce costs and improve customer service.</p>
    <p>GreenWear's regional distribution strategy does not fully leverage potential e-commerce channels globally, limiting customer reach compared to competitors with omnichannel distribution strategies targeting key growth markets effectively.</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Competitor Advantage</th><th>GreenWear Position</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Fast product cycles</td><td>Slow seasonal launches</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Advanced forecasting</td><td>Limited digital tools</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Omnichannel reach</td><td>Regional distribution only</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Low-cost structures</td><td>Higher ethical sourcing costs</td></tr>
    </table>

    <!-- SECTION 3: Service and Quality Designer -->
    <h2>3. Service and Quality</h2>
    <p>GreenWear’s quality management strategy aims to meet ethical standards while ensuring durability and comfort, but inconsistencies in supplier practices have led to higher defect rates in recent batches, impacting customer trust.</p>
    <p>Customer service lags due to delays in order fulfilment, with average delivery lead times exceeding customer expectations in key markets. This weakens GreenWear’s positioning as a reliable ethical alternative to fast-fashion brands.</p>
    <p>Return rates have increased, driven by sizing inconsistencies across product lines due to variability in manufacturing tolerances at supplier facilities in Bangladesh and Thailand, creating reverse logistics challenges.</p>
    <p>GreenWear’s physical and online store presence lacks integrated CRM systems, leading to fragmented customer feedback collection, limiting the organisation’s ability to rapidly adjust products and services to customer needs.</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Service/Quality Issue</th><th>Impact</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Defect rates</td><td>Customer dissatisfaction</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Delivery delays</td><td>Weakened market positioning</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Sizing inconsistencies</td><td>Increased returns</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Fragmented CRM</td><td>Slow responsiveness</td></tr>
    </table>

    <!-- SECTION 4: Sustainability Designer -->
    <h2>4. Sustainability</h2>
    <p>GreenWear has strong sustainability aspirations, sourcing organic cotton and using low-impact dyes, but rising costs and supply disruptions challenge the financial feasibility of maintaining these practices at scale.</p>
    <p>Carbon emissions from air freight used to manage urgent replenishments undermine GreenWear’s carbon neutrality goals, highlighting a misalignment between operational urgency and environmental targets.</p>
    <p>Social sustainability issues remain with supplier labour conditions, requiring continuous monitoring and improvement investments to ensure compliance with ethical standards in lower-cost manufacturing countries.</p>
    <p>Waste management practices are underdeveloped, with limited recycling initiatives for post-consumer products, reducing GreenWear’s ability to close the loop in a circular supply chain strategy.</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Sustainability Issue</th><th>Impact</th></tr>
        <tr><td>High cost of sustainable sourcing</td><td>Financial strain</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Air freight emissions</td><td>Carbon neutrality challenges</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Labour conditions</td><td>Compliance risks</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Limited recycling</td><td>Missed circularity goals</td></tr>
    </table>

    <!-- SECTION 5: Safety Designer -->
    <h2>5. Safety</h2>
    <p>GreenWear prioritises workplace safety in its direct operations, but ensuring consistent safety practices at supplier facilities remains a challenge due to varied safety cultures across manufacturing partners.</p>
    <p>Transportation safety risks, particularly during logistics operations in countries with higher road incident rates, create potential disruptions and damage to goods, impacting customer service reliability.</p>
    <p>Occupational health concerns in supplier factories, including poor ventilation and chemical exposure risks during dyeing processes, require ongoing audits and corrective actions to align with GreenWear’s safety values.</p>
    <p>Emergency preparedness across the supply chain is inconsistent, with suppliers lacking formal disaster recovery plans, creating vulnerabilities in the event of natural disasters or political instability.</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Safety Concern</th><th>Impact</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Supplier safety culture gaps</td><td>Worker injury risks</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Logistics safety</td><td>Goods damage, delays</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Occupational health risks</td><td>Non-compliance with standards</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Lack of disaster plans</td><td>Disruption vulnerability</td></tr>
    </table>

    <!-- SECTION 6: Execution Lead -->
    <h2>6. Execution</h2>
    <p>GreenWear’s execution challenges include frequent shipment delays due to reliance on low-cost, lower-reliability carriers, impacting stock availability across distribution centres in major markets.</p>
    <p>Coordination between production, logistics, and sales teams is weak due to fragmented data systems, leading to misalignment in production planning and demand forecasts, creating overstock or stockout issues.</p>
    <p>Supplier lead times vary significantly due to production capacity constraints and occasional raw material shortages, making reliable execution of replenishment schedules difficult.</p>
    <p>Returns processing is slow due to manual systems and limited reverse logistics partnerships, impacting customer satisfaction and adding operational costs.</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Execution Issue</th><th>Impact</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Shipment delays</td><td>Stock availability issues</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Data fragmentation</td><td>Planning misalignment</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Supplier lead time variability</td><td>Replenishment delays</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Slow returns processing</td><td>Customer dissatisfaction</td></tr>
    </table>

    <!-- SECTION 7: People & Culture Analyst -->
    <h2>7. People & Culture</h2>
    <p>GreenWear’s workforce faces high turnover in warehouse operations due to seasonal demand peaks and limited permanent roles, impacting operational stability and knowledge retention.</p>
    <p>Leadership engagement with frontline staff is limited, reducing opportunities for employee feedback and innovation in improving operational practices and customer service processes.</p>
    <p>Training programs are inconsistently delivered across locations, leading to variability in quality control practices and operational performance.</p>
    <p>GreenWear’s culture promotes sustainability and ethical sourcing, but employees often experience pressure to prioritise cost and speed due to competitive pressures, creating value misalignments within the organisation.</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>People & Culture Issue</th><th>Impact</th></tr>
        <tr><td>High turnover</td><td>Knowledge gaps</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Limited leadership engagement</td><td>Missed improvement opportunities</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Inconsistent training</td><td>Quality variability</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Value misalignment</td><td>Employee dissatisfaction</td></tr>
    </table>
